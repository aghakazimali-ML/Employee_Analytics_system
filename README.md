## Phase 1: Define Business Objectives (Start Here)

**What you must do first**

1. Clearly define **why** this system exists.

   * Support HR and management decisions
   * Identify compensation fairness
   * Understand departmental performance

2. Define **key questions** the system must answer:

   * Which departments cost the most?
   * Who are the top-performing employees?
   * Are salaries evenly distributed?
   * Where is data incomplete or unreliable?

**Deliverable:**

* Written problem statement
* List of business questions

## Phase 2: Dataset Planning & Understanding

**Before touching Pandas**

1. Decide what **employee attributes** are required:

   * Employee identity
   * Department
   * Salary
   * Performance indicators

2. Identify **data issues you expect**:

   * Missing salaries
   * Incomplete departments
   * Inconsistent records

3. Define **data assumptions**:

   * Salary ranges
   * Department limits
   * Ranking criteria

**Deliverable:**

* Dataset schema
* Data quality expectations

## Phase 3: Data Ingestion & Structure Validation

**Purpose:** Ensure data is usable before analysis.

1. Load employee data into a structured format
2. Validate:

   * Column presence
   * Data types
   * Row consistency
3. Identify:

   * Missing values
   * Duplicate records
   * Outliers

**Deliverable:**

* Clean data readiness report

## Phase 4: Missing Data Handling Strategy

**One of your core features**

1. Identify where data is missing
2. Classify missing data:

   * Critical (salary)
   * Non-critical (secondary attributes)
3. Decide handling strategies:

   * Removal
   * Replacement
   * Flagging for reporting

**Deliverable:**

* Missing data handling policy
* Cleaned dataset version

## Phase 5: Salary Analysis Module

**First major analytics feature**

1. Analyze salary distribution:

   * Overall organization
   * Per department
2. Identify:

   * Minimum, maximum, average
   * Salary gaps
   * Outliers
3. Compare salary trends across departments

**Deliverable:**

* Salary insight summary
* Visual salary distribution outputs

## Phase 6: Department Insights Module

**Second major analytics feature**

1. Group employees by department
2. Analyze:

   * Headcount per department
   * Average salary per department
   * Cost contribution
3. Identify high-cost vs high-value departments

**Deliverable:**

* Department comparison report
* Department-level visualizations

---

## Phase 7: Employee Ranking System

**Third core feature**

1. Define ranking criteria:

   * Salary-based
   * Performance-based
   * Composite ranking
2. Rank employees:

   * Organization-wide
   * Department-wise
3. Identify:

   * Top performers
   * Underperformers

**Deliverable:**

* Ranked employee tables
* Ranking logic documentation

---

## Phase 8: Visualization & Reporting

**Using Matplotlib**

1. Decide what must be visualized:

   * Salary distributions
   * Department comparisons
   * Top employee rankings
2. Choose appropriate chart types
3. Ensure clarity and interpretability

**Deliverable:**

* Final analytics charts
* Insight-ready visuals

---

## Phase 9: Insight Interpretation (Very Important)

**Analytics is useless without interpretation**

1. Translate numbers into insights
2. Answer original business questions
3. Highlight:

   * Risks
   * Opportunities
   * Recommendations

**Deliverable:**

* Insight narrative document

---

## Phase 10: Project Packaging & Presentation

**Make it “real-project ready”**

1. Organize notebooks/files logically
2. Add clear documentation:

   * Objective
   * Dataset description
   * Analysis summary
3. Prepare:

   * Screenshots of outputs
   * Final conclusions
   * Future improvement ideas

**Deliverable:**

* Portfolio-ready project
* GitHub-ready structure
